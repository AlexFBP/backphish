# PhishPayback: Phising Spammer

The idea is to combat phishing with spam, this is a hacking repo (needless to add "ethical").

Inspired in

- GitHub - [v3lip/PhishingSpammer](https://github.com/v3lip/PhishingSpammer/)
- YouTube - [@ScammerPayback](https://www.youtube.com/@ScammerPayback)

## Types

1. Send random data to phishing backends
2. TODO: Create DDOs attacks for frontends
3. TODO: Create DDOs attacks for backends

## Targets

For safety reasons, no URL will be in this readme, please check source code for details.

And also, for non-safety reasons, Why should I care about any exposed token in this repository? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
